	abstract = {An accurate prediction of house prices is a fundamental requirement for various sectors, including real estate and mortgage lending. It is widely recognized that a property’s value is not solely determined by its physical attributes but is significantly influenced by its surrounding neighborhood. Meeting the diverse housing needs of individuals while balancing budget constraints is a primary concern for real estate developers. To this end, we addressed the house price prediction problem as a regression task and thus employed various machine learning ({ML}) techniques capable of expressing the significance of independent variables. We made use of the housing dataset of Ames City in Iowa, {USA} to compare {XGBoost}, support vector regressor, random forest regressor, multilayer perceptron, and multiple linear regression algorithms for house price prediction. Afterwards, we identified the key factors that influence housing costs. Our results show that {XGBoost} is the best performing model for house price prediction. Our findings present valuable insights and tools for stakeholders, facilitating more accurate property price estimates and, in turn, enabling more informed decision making to meet the housing needs of diverse populations while considering budget constraints.},

	abstract = {The relationship between foreign direct investment ({FDI}), trade openness and economic growth in host countries remains one of the most important issues in the economic literature and met with renewed interest in recent years mainly for countries suffering from unemployment problems and lack of technological progress. This paper examines this issue for Tunisia by applying the bounds testing ({ARDL}) approach to cointegration for the period from 1970 to 2008. The bounds tests suggest that the variables of interest are bound together in the long run when foreign direct investment is the dependent variable. The associated equilibrium correction is also significant, confirming the existence of a long-run relationship. The results also indicate that there is no significant Granger causality from {FDI} to economic growth, from economic growth to {FDI}, from trade to economic growth and from economic growth to trade in the short run. Even though there is a widespread belief that {FDI} can generate positive spillover externalities for the host country, our empirical results fail to confirm this belief for the case of Tunisia. They go against the generally accepted idea considering the positive impact of {FDI} on economic growth to be automatic. The results found for Tunisia can be generalized and compared to other developing countries which share a common experience in attracting {FDI} and trade liberalization.},

The ardl command can be used to fit an {ARDL} model with the optimal number of autoregressive and distributed lags based on the Akaike or Bayesian (Schwarz) information criterion. The regression results can be displayed in the {ARDL} levels form or in the error-correction representation of the model. The latter separates long-run and short-run effects and is available in two different parameterizations of the long-run (cointegrating) relationship. The popular bounds-testing procedure for the existence of a long-run levels relationship is implemented as a postestimation feature. Comprehensive critical values and approximate p-values obtained from response-surface regressions facilitate statistical inference.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary The forecasts of higher quality can be obtained through the use of a wider information set. For example, the forecaster may know of the possibility of an impending strike in the coal industry. However, he will generally not know for sure that the strike is to take place and almost certainly will be unsure of its duration. Thus, in addition to assessing the likely impact of the strike on the variable of interest, the forecaster must inject into his forecast an assessment of the probability of the strike taking place at all and also its likely duration. Presumably, this kind of subjective judgment can be incorporated into a formal Bayesian treatment of the forecasting problem. However, the methods used in practice are of a more ad hoc nature. Consideration of a wider information set for forecasting purposes introduces two concepts. First, it is necessary to examine and make use of any theory that postulates relationships determining the variable of interest, and second, one might attempt to extend the univariate models to the multivariate case. In this chapter, traditional econometric approaches to forecasting, whereby economic theory is employed in the construction of equations to be used in prediction, are discussed.},

	abstract = {[This paper develops a new approach to the problem of testing the existence of a level relationship between a dependent variable and a set of regressors, when it is not known with certainty whether the underlying regressors are trend- or first-difference stationary. The proposed tests are based on standard F- and t-statistics used to test the significance of the lagged levels of the variables in a univariate equilibrium correction mechanism. The asymptotic distributions of these statistics are non-standard under the null hypothesis that there exists no level relationship, irrespective of whether the regressors are I(0) or I(1). Two sets of asymptotic critical values are provided: one when all regressors are purely I(1) and the other if they are all purely 1(0). These two sets of critical values provide a band covering all possible classifications of the regressors into purely I(0), purely I(1) or mutually cointegrated. Accordingly, various bounds testing procedures are proposed. It is shown that the proposed tests are consistent, and their asymptotic distribution under the null and suitably defined local alternatives are derived. The empirical relevance of the bounds procedures is demonstrated by a re-examination of the earnings equation included in the {UK} Treasury macroeconometric model.]},

The determinants of real house price appreciation, then, can be divided into two groups: one that explains changes in the equilibrium price and another that accounts for the adjustment dynamics or changing deviations from the equilibrium price. The former group includes the growth in real income and real construction costs and changes in the real after-tax interest rate. The latter group consists of lagged real appreciation and the difference between the actual and equilibrium real house price levels. Either group of variables can explain a little over two-fifths of the variation in real house price movements in 30 cities over the 1977–92 period; together, they explain three-fifths.]},
